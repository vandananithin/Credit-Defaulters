Credit card default prediction
In the classification algorithm of supervised machine learning the data set is imbalanced. so i performed the smote technique and observed the metrics like 
accuracy, F1_score and confusion matrix to find out the correct prediction and negative predictions by the models.
clearly mention the metrics before application of SMOTE and after appication of SMOTE. Also scalled the numerical data by Standard scaler and performed the
Feature importance by, random forest, decision tree, and boosting algorithms.
